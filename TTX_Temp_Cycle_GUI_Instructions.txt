                    TEMPERATURE CYCLING GUI 
===============================================================================

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
- Python 3.x with the following packages:
  * tkinter (usually included with Python)
  * pyvisa
  * threading
  * time
  * datetime
- GPIB interface hardware
- ICS-4899A temperature chamber connected via GPIB (Address 4)

STARTING THE APPLICATION
------------------------
1. Ensure the temperature chamber is connected via GPIB
2. Run the application by running batch file on the home screen
3. The GUI will automatically attempt to connect to the GPIB device
4. Connection status will be displayed at the top of the window

GUI LAYOUT AND COMPONENTS
-------------------------

1. CONNECTION STATUS
   - Located at the top of the window
   - Shows current connection status: Connected/Disconnected/Connection Failed
   - Green = Connected, Red = Disconnected/Failed

2. TEMPERATURE SETTINGS FRAME
   - Low Temperature (°F): Set the lower temperature limit for cycling
   - High Temperature (°F): Set the upper temperature limit for cycling  
   - Hold Time (minutes): Duration to maintain each temperature after reaching target
   - Default values: Low=32°F, High=140°F, Hold=5 minutes

3. COMMUNICATION SETTINGS FRAME
   - GPIB Timeout (ms): Communication timeout for GPIB operations
   - Default: 5000ms (5 seconds)
   - Click "Apply" button to update timeout settings

4. CURRENT STATUS FRAME
   - Current Temperature: Real-time chamber temperature reading
   - Target Temperature: Currently set target temperature
   - Cycling Status: Current operation status (Stopped/Running/Stopping)
   - Hold Timer: Progress of current hold period (elapsed/total time)
   - Cycle Count: Number of complete temperature cycles completed

5. TRANSITION TIMING FRAME
   - Current Phase: Current operation (Heating/Cooling/Stabilizing)
   - Transition Timer: Time elapsed during current temperature transition
   - Last Heating Time: Duration of most recent heating transition
   - Last Cooling Time: Duration of most recent cooling transition
   - Avg Heating Time: Average heating transition time across all cycles
   - Avg Cooling Time: Average cooling transition time across all cycles

6. CONTROL BUTTONS
   - Start Cycling: Begin automated temperature cycling
   - Stop Cycling: Stop current cycling operation
   - Reset Counter: Reset cycle counter to zero
   - Reset Timing: Clear all transition timing data

7. ACTIVITY LOG
   - Scrollable text area showing all system activities
   - Timestamped entries for all operations
   - Includes temperature readings, errors, and status changes

OPERATING 
--------------------

STARTING TEMPERATURE CYCLING:
1. Ensure all temperature settings are configured
2. Click "Start Cycling" button
3. Monitor the cycling progress in the Current Status and Activity Log
4. The system will automatically:
   - Turn on the temperature chamber
   - Cycle between low and high temperatures
   - Maintain each temperature for the specified hold time
   - Track transition times and cycle counts

MONITORING:
1. Current Temperature: Updates every 3 seconds during operation
2. Target Temperature: Shows the currently set temperature goal
3. Hold Timer: Shows progress during temperature stabilization periods
4. Transition Timer: Shows time elapsed during heating/cooling phases
5. Activity Log: Provides detailed information about all operations

STOPPING:
1. Click "Stop Cycling" to halt operations
2. System will complete current operation before stopping
3. Temperature chamber will be automatically turned off
4. All timing and status displays will be reset

TRANSITION TIMING:
- System automatically tracks heating vs cooling transition times
- Calculates average times to help optimize cycling parameters
- Times are displayed in MM:SS format
- Use "Reset Timing" to clear historical data

CYCLE COUNTING:
- Automatically increments after each complete cycle (low→high→low)
- Use "Reset Counter" to start counting from zero
- Counter persists until manually reset

CONFIGURATION 
-------------------------

Temperature Settings:
- Low Temperature: Minimum cycling temperature (default: 32°F) (Oven can go as low as -40°F)
- High Temperature: Maximum cycling temperature (default: 140°F)(Oven can go as high as 266°F)
- Hold Time: Stabilization time at each temperature (default: 5 minutes)

Communication Settings:
- GPIB Timeout: Base timeout for GPIB operations (default: 5000ms)
- Temperature Read Timeout: Extended timeout for temp reads (2x base timeout)
- Retry Count: Number of retry attempts for failed operations (default: 3)

Stabilization Parameters:
- Temperature Tolerance: ±2.5°F (how close to target before considering "reached")
- Stabilization Time: User-configurable hold time
- Temperature Read Interval: 3 seconds during stabilization


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Connection Issues:
- Verify GPIB cable connections
- Check device, if red light, power on and power off the control box on top of oven

Temperature Control Issues:
- Verify chamber is powered on 
- Check temperature settings are within chamber capabilities
- Increase hold time if temperatures are not stabilizing
- Make sure the oven is cooling or heating. Power cycle if having issue

Data Reset:
- Use "Reset Counter" to clear cycle count
- Use "Reset Timing" to clear transition timing history
- Restart application to reset all parameters to defaults

ERROR MESSAGES AND MEANINGS
---------------------------
- "Connection Failed": Cannot establish GPIB communication
- "Temperature read failure": Cannot read current temperature
- "GPIB timeout": Communication timeout occurred
- "Failed to set temperature": Cannot send temperature command
- "Reconnection failed": Automatic reconnection unsuccessful
